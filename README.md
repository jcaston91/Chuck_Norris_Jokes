# Chuck_Norris_Jokes

This was my first project working with an API. I was also only slightly familiar with working with JSON's. This was fun because after I got the assignment working I was able to sit at my computer for a very long time and look at some pretty good Chuck Norris jokes.

If this is your first time working with an API I highly recommend you start here to get a good understanding.
